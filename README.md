Repose is a design system made for text-heavy interfaces, such as text editors, terminals, and web pages. The colors are designed to be consistent in perceived brightness and easy on the eyes while remaining high-contrast.

*Have an idea for an application that should be themed? Feel free to leave an [issue]()! Applications that require GUI modifications will need to wait for a design system to allow for a unified look across applications.*

## Installation
Installation will vary depending on the application you are installing the theme for. For the specific application, read the README.md file in that folder for instructions.
